<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<p>This application shows how much real time is left until Christmas.</p>
<p>For the falling snow effect, I used JavaScript library for creating particles https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js</p>
<p>The Gsap animation adds the effect of smooth appearance of blocks.</p>
<p>When the user clicks on the Play button, music starts playing and the image of the button changes.</p>
